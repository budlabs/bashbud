## bashbud - make(1) bash scripting better

The **bashbud** script/command is a very simple
`cp(1)` wrapper that simply merge a directory
from `~/.config/bashbud/` into a target
directory. The directories in `~/.config/bashbud`
are called *templates*, and the default template
is called *default*. The default template have a
carefully created **Makefile**, that makes (no pun
intended) bash script maintenance pleasant.
Especially in regards to managing commandline
options and documentation.  

There is a [tutorial in the wiki], that walks you
through all the functionality of the **bashbud**
command and what the **Makefile** does.
